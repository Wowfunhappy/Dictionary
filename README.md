Fork of the iOS 5-era https://github.com/forresty-archive/Dictionary, made for personal use. I did the bare-minimum to make the app compile and look pretty on my iPhone 6S running iOS 12.1.1.

I don't actually know anything about iOS development. My strategy for getting the app to compile on a modern SDK was to keep commenting out lines until xCode finally shut up. (I think most of what I removed were just automated tests for development purposes.) However, the app itself feels perfectly polished and stable on my iPhone. I updated the fonts and colors to fit the non-skeumorphic style of modern iOS.

The Releases tab contains both an unsigned IPA (for Cydia Impactor / "Signing Services") and a DEB (for Jailbroken devices). 

I wish Apple allowed apps like this in the App Store. It would have saved me a lot of trouble.
