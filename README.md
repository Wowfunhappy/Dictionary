Fork of the iOS 6-era https://github.com/forresty-archive/Dictionary, made for personal use. I did the bare-minimum to make the app compile and look pretty on my iPhone 6S running iOS 12.1.1.

I don't actually know anything about iOS development. My strategy for getting the app to compile on a modern SDK was to keep commenting out lines until xCode finally shut up. (I think most of what I removed were just automated tests for development purposes.) However, the app itself feels perfectly polished and stable on my iPhone.

An unsigned IPA is available in the releases tab. Note that if you use a Plus- or X-model iPhone, you will likely want to create a device-specific launch image.

I wish Apple allowed apps like this in the App Store. It would have saved me a lot of trouble.
